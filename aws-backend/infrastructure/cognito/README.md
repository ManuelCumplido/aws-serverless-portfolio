## Cognito Stack: User Pool, Client, Domain & Groups for SmartLockers

This stack provisions **Amazon Cognito resources** for the SmartLockers demo project.  
It enables secure user authentication and authorization via a hosted user pool, app client, domain, and role-based groups.

### üìÑ Templates
- **cognito-lockers-stack.yaml**  
  - Creates the **SmartLockersUserPool** for managing authentication.  
  - Defines the **SmartLockersUserPoolClient** for frontend/mobile applications.  
  - Configures a **Cognito Hosted UI Domain** (`smartlockers-auth`) for login/logout.  
  - Creates **User Groups**: `admins` and `users` for role-based access control.  
  - Exports IDs and domain for integration with other stacks (e.g., Lambdas, API Gateway).
